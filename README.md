#### The purpose of this app is to add burgers to the Created column, and move them to the Devoured column by pressing the Devour button. I haven't gotten this function to work, and I can't figure out why it isn't working. The image is also not showing up on the Heroku app. The columns mysteriously appeared on the deployed app after I tried changing the img ref, but the buttons are still non-functional. The console returns two 404 errors for assets/js/burgers.js and assets/img/burger.png, but they are both where their reference links are supposed to be. It could also look better, but I was saving major design tweaks until I could get it functional.

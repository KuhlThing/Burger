#### The purpose of this app is for the user to create a list of burgers they would like to try, and then log them in the column on the right when they have. The user inputs burger types into the "Add A Burger" section and clicks the Submit button, then that burger is added to the Burgers Created column on the left, with a button next to it that says "Eat A Burger." This button takes that burger and adds it to the Burgers Devoured column.

#### The purpose of this app is to add burgers to the Created column, and move them to the Devoured column by pressing the Devour button. I haven't gotten this function to work, and I can't figure out why it isn't working. The image is also not showing up on the Heroku app. The columns mysteriously appeared on the deployed app after I tried changing the img ref.
